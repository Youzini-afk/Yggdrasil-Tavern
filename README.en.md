# YdlTavern

> [English](./README.en.md) · [中文](./README.md)

**A conversation and roleplay project running on [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/Youzini-afk/Yggdrasil), compatible with SillyTavern's character cards, world books, presets, chats, and extensions.**

YdlTavern brings the content formats and extension ecosystem the SillyTavern community has built up over the years onto the Yggdrasil platform substrate. The frontend stays familiar; the engine layer uses Yggdrasil's modern implementation.

## What it does

- Imports SillyTavern character cards (V1 / V2 / V3), world books, prompt presets, and chat history directly.
- Supports SillyTavern's extension API (`getContext()`, `eventSource`, slash commands, etc.) so existing extensions can run.
- Keeps the UI structure and interaction flow familiar to longtime SillyTavern users, with the frontend rewritten from scratch.
- Uses Yggdrasil for the engine layer: model integration, `secret_ref`, streaming lifecycle, proposal approval, outbound audit, memory / retrieval, and agent infrastructure all come from the platform.

## Relationship to Yggdrasil

YdlTavern is an integration project on top of Yggdrasil. It consumes the platform through the public protocol (HTTP `/rpc` plus SSE).

- It does not live in the Yggdrasil repo. Platform and product stay separate.
- It gets the same treatment as any third-party project: same manifest, same permissions, same audit boundary.
- It uses what Yggdrasil already provides: model integration, `secret_ref`, streaming and cancel lifecycle, proposals and approval, memory, sharing, outbound audit.
- It will use what Yggdrasil is about to add: installing capability packages from a GitHub address — the prerequisite for YdlTavern's extension ecosystem.

For Yggdrasil's side of the boundary, see [Yggdrasil/docs/tavern/TAVERN_COMPAT.md](https://github.com/Youzini-afk/Yggdrasil/blob/main/docs/tavern/TAVERN_COMPAT.en.md).

## Acknowledgements

The character cards, world books, presets, chat history, and extension APIs are the work of the SillyTavern team and community over many years. YdlTavern does compatibility work on top of that — credit goes to them.
